This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error when accessing elements in a C++ `std::vector`.  The `bug.cpp` file contains code that attempts to access an element beyond the vector's bounds, leading to a segmentation fault. The `bugSolution.cpp` file shows the corrected code with the proper bounds check. This example highlights the importance of careful indexing and boundary checks when working with containers in C++.  Understanding and avoiding these errors is crucial for writing robust and reliable C++ applications.
